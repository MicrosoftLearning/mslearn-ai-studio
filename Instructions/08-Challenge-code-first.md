# Build a custom copilot code-first with the Azure AI Studio

In this exercise, you'll build a custom copilot application code-first with the Azure AI Studio.

> To complete this exercise, your Azure subscription must be approved for access to the Azure OpenAI service. Fill in the [registration form](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access) to request access to Azure OpenAI models.

This exercise will take approximately **90** minutes.

## Create an AI hub and project in the Azure AI Studio

You start by creating an Azure AI Studio project within an Azure AI hub:

1. In a web browser, open [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) and sign in using your Azure credentials.
1. Select the **Home** page, then select **+ New project**.
1. In the **Create a new project** wizard, create a project with the following settings:
    - **Project name**: *A unique name for your project*
    - **Hub**: *Create a new hub with the following settings:*
        - **Hub name**: *A unique name*
        - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
        - **Resource group**: *A new resource group*
        - **Location**: *Make a **random** choice from any of the following regions*\*
        - Australia East
        - Canada East
        - East US
        - East US 2
        - France Central
        - Japan East
        - North Central US
        - Sweden Central
        - Switzerland North
        - UK South
    - **Connect Azure AI Services or Azure OpenAI**: *Create a new connection*
    - **Connect Azure AI Search**: Skip connecting

    > \* Azure OpenAI resources are constrained at the tenant level by regional quotas. The listed regions include default quota for the model type(s) used in this exercise. Randomly choosing a region reduces the risk of a single region reaching its quota limit. In the event of a quota limit being reached later in the exercise, there's a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region. Learn more about [model availability per region](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-35-turbo-model-availability)

1. Review your configuration and create your project.
1. Wait for your project to be created.



## Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring the Azure AI Studio, you should delete the resources you’ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

- Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
- In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
- Select the resource group that you created for this exercise.
- At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
- Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.
